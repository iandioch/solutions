I'm adding my project euler solutions here to get them all organised in one 
place. Some of the problems I solved in a REPL however.

My project euler profile:

My friend key:
`606734_ef9b41477e3c782264e98a3014b920dc`

Following the updated instructions, I removed all solutions > ID 100, and put
them in a private repo.
